This document contains all major version changes between Chanjo releases.

2.2.2 (Active Development)
---------------------------

2.1.1 (Current stable)
-----------------------

**Bugfixes**

- Fix interval assertion that didn't allow intervals to start and end on the same chromosomal position.


2.1.0
------

**Features**

- Add lazy loading of `chanjo.Store` through new `chanjo.Store.connect` method


**Bugfixes**

- Fix case where "demo" subcommand fails (`__package__` not set)


**Documentation**

- Much improved documentation of changes between releases


2.0.2
------

**Bugfixes**

- Rename misspelled method (non-breaking): `chanjo.Store.tare_down` to `chanjo.Store.tear_down`


**Documentation**

- Fix some CSS selectors in theme
- Reorder API references in API docs


2.0.1
------

- Adds validation to check that stdin isn't empty


**Documentation**

- Fixes link to logo on front page
- Adds John Kern as collaborator
- Adds link to Master's Thesis paper for reference in README
- Adds more FAQ


2.0.0 "Wistful Weasel"
-----------------------

Being a major release, expect previous scripts written for Chanjo 1.x to be incompatible with Chanjo 2.x.

**Features**

- New built-in "demo" subcommand in the CLI
- New public setuptools entry point for Chanjo plugins (CLI subcommands)
- New official public Python API (stable until 3.x release). Read more in the new `API documentation`_.
- New "sex-checker" bonus command to guess gender from BAM alignment.

- Command line interface updates
  - :code:`--out` option removed across CLI. Use :code:`>|` to redirect STDOUT instead.
  - :code:`--prepend` is now known as :code:`--prefix`
  - :code:`--db` and :code:`--dialect` must be supplied directly after "chanjo" on the command line (not after the subcommand). Like: :code:`chanjo --db ./coverage.sqlite import annotations.bed`.
  - :code:`--extend-by` is now :code:`--extendby`

- Config file format has changed from JSON to `TOML`_. It's a more readable format (think INI) that also supports comments!

- Improves BED-format compliance. Chanjo will now expect the "score" field to be in position 5 (and strand in position 6). The Chanjo specific fields start from position 7.

- Major internal code restructuring. Essentially everything is built as plugins/self-contained components. Since no official Python API existed pre Chanjo 2, I won't go into any details here.

- Improves documentation.

- Last but not least, Chanjo will now code name releases according to animals in the Musteloidea superfamily :)

**Internal changes**

- Introduces a new compat module to better support Python 2+3.
- Trades command line framework from "docopt" to "click" to build more flexible nested commands.
- Adds a first hand `BaseInterval` object to unify handling of intervals inside Chanjo.
- BamFile no-longer requires numpy as a hard dependency. You still likely want to keep it though for performance reasons.
