--cutoff;The “cutoff” is used for the completeness calculation. Set it to the number of reads that you deem “sufficient” coverage.
--extend-by;A handy way to extend  each interval to include e.g. splice sites in the case of exonic intervals. In that case you would set it to “2”.
--sample;A unique sample Id. If you don’t specify one, Chanjo will generate a memorable string Id for you.
--group;Grouping option for samples. Can for example be used to relate family members in a trio.
--institute;Grouping option for groups. Somewhat contrived but useful to resolve conflicts between sample Ids in a shared database. “institute” + “sample” must form a unique combined Id. This will likely be set in your config file.
--prepend;Prepend a string to all chromosome/contig Ids. This is useful when you need to convert between UCSC and ENSEMBL formats.
--threshold;Optimization option. Chanjo reads the BAM-file in chunks determined by the “threshold”. 17000 is a good number for the CCDS exons.
--config;Pointer to a config file. Chanjo will automatically look one but this let’s you be more flexible when it comes to where it’s stored.
--out;Let’s you define a file other than stdout to write output to. This is only really useful if you are having issues forcing Bash to overwrite existing files.
--force;Boolean options to overwrite an existing output file. Must be used in combination with the “out” options.
