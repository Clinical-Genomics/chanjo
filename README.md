# Chanjo [![PyPI version][fury-image]][fury-url] [![Build Status][travis-image]][travis-url] [![Coverage Status][coveralls-image]][coveralls-url] [![bioconda-badge][bioconda-img]][bioconda-url]

Chanjo is coverage analysis for clinical sequencing. It's implemented in Python
with a command line interface that adheres to [UNIX pipeline philosophy][unix].

## Installation
Chanjo is distributed through `pip`. Install the latest stable release by
running:

```bash
pip install chanjo
```

... or locally for development:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/robinandeer/chanjo.git
cd chanjo
conda install --channel bioconda sambamba
pip install --requirements requirements-dev.txt --editable .
```

## Usage
Chanjo exposes a decomposable command line interface with a nifty config file
implementation.

```bash
chanjo init --setup
chanjo load /path/to/sambamba.output.bed
chanjo calculate mean
{"metrics": {"completeness_10": 90.92, "mean_coverage": 193.85}, "sample_id": "sample1"}
```

## Documentation
Read the Docs is hosting the [official documentation][docs].

If you are looking to learn more about handling sequence coverage data in
clinical sequencing, feel free to download and skim through my own
[Master's thesis][thesis] and article references.

## Features

### What Chanjo does
Chanjo leverages [Sambamba][sambamba] to annotate coverage and completeness
for a general BED-file. The output can then easily to loaded into a SQL
database that enables investigation of coverage across regions and samples.
The database also works as an API to downstream tools like the Chanjo
Coverage Report generator.

### What Chanjo doesn't
Chanjo is not the right choice if you care about coverage for every base across
the entire genome. Detailed histograms is something [BEDTools][bedtools]
already handles with confidence.
