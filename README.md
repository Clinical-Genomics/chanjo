## What is it?
DNA sequencing is moving into clinical applications. We need tools to determine coverage for clinically relevant abstractions such as genes, transcripts, and exons.

Chanjo provides this functionality in a more intuitive way than dealing with BED-intervals.

## Main features
| Feature            | Description   |
| ------------------ | ------------- |
| BAM support        | Generate coverage directly from BAM alignments. Fit's right into your genomics pipeline. |
| Just what you need | Limit calculations to a list of genes of interest. |
